Description: A small, lightweight package containing tools commonly used to 
    perform small-sample equating. Identity, mean, linear, and circle-arc
    equating are possible as well as the nominal weights, Tucker, Levine
    observed-score, Levine true-score, and chained methods. Any number of
    individual equatings may be combined to produce a weighted result. Bootstrap
    estimates are also available.
